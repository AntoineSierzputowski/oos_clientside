Need to generate 3 JS scripts who will run on the browser.

1. The first script will be conditions to detect if the user is on a product page.

Example:
if pathname includes '/product/' => run the script 2


2. The second script will be a popup that will be shown when the user is on a product page.
JS script:
  - detect if the product is in stock
  - if the product is out of stock, show the popup => script 3
  - if the product is in stock, do nothing


3. The third script will be a popup that will be shown when the user is on a product page.
JS script:
- inject HTML code in the page
- inject CSS code in the page
- the request POST code

Questions: 
How we generate these scripts? What information we need to provide? 

- Script 1: the conditions 
Example: 
if pathname includes '/product/' or dataLayer.typepage == 'product'

- Script 2: how to detect if the product is out of stock?
Example: "out_of_stock_indicator": "class= \"unselectable \""

- Script 3: the design of the popup + product details (optional)
Example:
- HTML + CSS
- if need size input => add size input

Create a brief to collect the information from the user.

JSON object:

      "value": "dataLayer.typepage == 'product'"
    }
  ],
  "out_of_stock_indicator": "class= \"unselectable \"",
  "popup": {
    "html": "html code",
    "css": "css code",
  },
  "product_details": {
    "name": "product name",
    "url": "product url"
  }
